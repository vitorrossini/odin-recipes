   <p>Who doesn't love a cheesy sauced lasagna with a size of a brick, am i right?</p>
   <p>So i will show you now how to make this delicious dish with a simple and easy recipe.</p>
<br>
   <h3>Ingredients</h3>

   <ul>
       <li>2 packs of lasagna pasta</li>
       <li>3 glasses of ready to go sauce</li>
       <li>At least 300gr of cheese (the more the marrier)</li>
       <li>500gr of grind meat</li>
       <li>300gr of ham</li>
   </ul>
   <br>

   <p>Seems preety easy already, right? Ok, lets make it!</p>

   <br>
   <ol>
       <li>First thing you need to do is to drop a bit of the sauce on your baking tray, so our first layer doesnt stick on it;</li>
       <li>Preheat the oven to 200ÂºC or something like that, i don't really remember;</li>
       <li>Now we will work with layers here, so what you need to do is to cover the whole tray with a layer of lasagna pasta, then sauce, meat, cheese and ham;</li>
       <li>Repeat this until you have no more ingredients or your tray is full;</li>
       <li>Add sauce and cheese on top so we get a crusty cheese.</li>
       <li>Put it on the oven and wait until it starts to smell good (which will be probably 25 minutes);</li>
       <li>Take it out of the oven and enjoy!</li>
   </ol>
<br>
<p>That's it! I hope you liked it as much as i did.</p>
<p>See you next time!</p>
